Discord Rich Presence daemon for Visual Novels on Linux. Detects games launched via **Lutris** or **Steam**, looks them up on [VNDB](https://vndb.org), and shows the title, cover art, and total playtime in your Discord status.

## Features

- Detects games from **Lutris** (exact name from wrapper) and **Steam** (AppID → ACF → store name)
- Fuzzy title matching against VNDB using trigram similarity + full-width character normalisation
- Fallback: searches the **release** endpoint and follows the relation back to the parent VN
- Suppresses explicit cover images (sexual ≥ 1.80 or violence ≥ 1.80) — title still shows
- Playtime from **Lutris DB** (`pga.db`) or **Steam VDF** (`localconfig.vdf`) — no API key needed
- Discord elapsed timer reflects **total hours played**, not just this session
- Editable `cache.csv` for aliases, hard-links, and SKIP entries — reloaded live while running
- `ignore.txt` with exact-match for short entries (< 4 chars) to prevent false positives like `sh`

## How it works

### Main loop

Every 5 seconds the daemon runs detection, debounces the result, checks the cache, queries VNDB if needed, and updates Discord.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Detection\nLutris or Steam] --> B[Debounce\nstable 2 polls]
    B --> C{Cache\nlookup}
    C -- hit + fresh --> E[Discord RPC]
    C -- hit + expired --> D[VNDB search]
    C -- miss --> D
    D --> E
```

---

### Detection

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P[Scan /proc every 5s]
    P --> L{lutris-wrapper\nin cmdline?}
    L -- yes --> LN[Game name from\nwrapper args]
    L -- no --> S{SteamAppId\nin environ?}
    S -- yes --> SA[Read appmanifest_ID.acf\nfrom all library paths]
    SA --> SN[Steam store name]
    S -- no --> NONE[Nothing detected]
    LN --> ST[Read starttime\nfrom /proc/pid/stat field 22]
    SN --> ST
    ST --> SORT[Sort candidates\nby starttime ascending]
```

Lutris passes the game name explicitly as command-line arguments after `lutris-wrapper`, so the name is always exact. Steam injects `SteamAppId` as an environment variable into every game process — the daemon reads it from `/proc/<pid>/environ`, then finds the matching `.acf` file across all Steam library paths (including custom drives read from `libraryfolders.vdf`).

After all candidates are collected, the daemon reads **field 22** (`starttime`) from each process's `/proc/<pid>/stat`. Candidates are then **sorted ascending by starttime**, so the process that launched first is always tried first during VNDB resolution. This makes multi-candidate priority deterministic and reproducible across polls.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [/proc/\[PID\]/stat field reference](proc_stat_fields.md) for a full breakdown of all stat fields.

> [!TIP]
> Run with `--verbose` to see candidates list in the debug output:
> ```
> [DEBUG] src/main.cpp:73 4 game candidate(s) found:
>   [DEBUG] src/main.cpp:75   [lutris] pid=2037324  name="終ノ空 remake"  starttime(clock ticks)=4906595
>   [DEBUG] src/main.cpp:75   [lutris] pid=2086738  name="X-Plane 12"  starttime(clock ticks)=4906701
>   [DEBUG] src/main.cpp:75   [steam-appid] pid=2037822  name="心象天儀本線 ~Per aspera ad astra~ Demo"  starttime(clock ticks)=4906857
>   [DEBUG] src/main.cpp:75   [lutris] pid=2038526  name="サクラノ詩－櫻の森の上を舞う－"  starttime(clock ticks)=4907260
> ```

### VNDB resolution

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q[Search query] --> VN[POST /kana/vn]
    VN --> SIM{Trigram similarity\n≥ 0.35 OR substring match?}
    SIM -- yes --> MATCH[VnInfo returned]
    SIM -- no --> REL[POST /kana/release]
    REL --> FOUND{Release found?}
    FOUND -- yes --> ID[Fetch parent VN\nby exact ID]
    ID --> MATCH
    FOUND -- no --> NOMATCH[No match\nclear presence]
```

Before the similarity check, full-width ASCII (`！２→!2`, `（→(`) is normalised to half-width so Japanese game names from Lutris match VNDB's stored titles. There is also a substring boost — if the query appears inside the returned title, the score is raised to at least 0.6, handling cases where the detected name is a short prefix of a long VNDB title.

---

### Cache TTL

VNDB results are stored persistently in `cache.csv`. On each cache hit the daemon compares the entry's `cached_at` timestamp against `VNDB_CACHE_TTL`. If the entry is older than the TTL, it is treated as expired and a fresh VNDB query is issued, updating the stored data and timestamp.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    HIT[Cache hit] --> AGE{age > VNDB_CACHE_TTL?}
    AGE -- no --> USE[Use cached VnInfo]
    AGE -- yes --> REQUERY[Re-query VNDB\nupdate cache.csv]
    REQUERY --> USE
```

This means ratings, cover images, and release dates in the cache are automatically refreshed over time without any manual intervention. The log line when a re-query fires looks like:

```
[INFO] Cache expired for "..."  age=1442min/1440min — re-querying VNDB
```

---

### Playtime → Discord elapsed timer

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SRC{Source?}
    SRC -- lutris --> LDB[Lutris DB\npga.db · hours]
    SRC -- steam-appid --> VDF[Steam VDF\nlocalconfig.vdf · minutes]
    LDB --> PT[playtime in seconds]
    VDF --> PT
    PT --> TS[start_ts = now − playtime]
    TS --> DISC[Discord: elapsed timer\ncounts up from start_ts]
```

---

### Cache file (`cache.csv` / `cache.db`)

Located at `~/.config/vn-discord-rpc/cache.csv` (default) or `cache.db` when `CACHE_USE_DB = true`. Reloaded automatically whenever the file changes on disk.

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `key` | Detected Visual Novels name (the search term) |
| `alias` | Redirect this key to a different search term |
| `vndb_id` | `v562`, `v67`, `SKIP`, or empty |
| `title` | Romanised VNDB title (auto-filled) |
| `alt_title` | Original script title, e.g. Japanese (auto-filled) |
| `image_url` | Cover image URL (auto-filled, blank if explicit(sexual or violence)) |
| `image_sexual` | VNDB sexual rating 0–2 (auto-filled) |
| `image_violence` | VNDB violence rating 0–2 (auto-filled) |
| `rating` | VNDB community rating 0–100 (auto-filled) |
| `released` | Release date (auto-filled) |
| `cached_at` | Unix timestamp of last write (auto-filled) |

**Examples:**

```csv
# Alias — fix wrong or garbled detection
Nice boat!,School Days,,,,,,,,

# Skip — suppress presence for this title
妹ぱらだいす！２,,SKIP,,,,,,,

# Hard-link — bypass VNDB query, point directly to an entry
My VN Title,,v67,,,,,,,
```

---

### Ignore list (`ignore.txt`)

Located at `~/.config/vn-discord-rpc/ignore.txt`. One entry per line, `#` for comments. Reloaded automatically while running.

Matching rules:
- Entry **< 4 characters**: exact match (case-insensitive) — (ie. prevents `sh` matching `Higurashi`)
- Entry **≥ 4 characters**: case-insensitive substring match

The default file includes common false-positives: Steam runtimes, Proton, Wine helpers, and launchers.

> [!WARNING]
> If a title has no VNDB match, the daemon automatically adds it to ignore.txt after the first failed query.
> It will not be retried on subsequent polls. To force a retry, remove the entry from ignore.txt.
> To permanently suppress it without querying VNDB at all, add a SKIP entry to cache.csv instead.

---

## Configuration (`src/config.hpp`)

> [!CAUTION]
> Be caution on changing `IMAGE_SEXUAL` and `IMAGE_VIOLENCE` thresholds in `src/config.hpp`.
> Those thresholds are set to `1.80` (slightly below VNDB's **Explicit** level of `2.00`)
> because VNDB image ratings are user-reported and may be underrated by a small margin —
> the 0.20 buffer ensures borderline explicit covers are still suppressed.
> Raising the threshold above `2.00` would cause explicit (pornographic) cover art to appear
> in your Discord status, visible to everyone on your friends list. Displaying explicit
> content in Discord Rich Presence may violates [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)
> and **may result in a permanent account ban**.

| Constant | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_APP_ID` | `1482345564698841189` | Discord application ID |
| `IMAGE_SEXUAL` | `1.80` | Maximum threshold value for sexual before being suppressed |
| `IMAGE_VIOLENCE` | `1.80` | Maximum threshold value for violence before being suppressed |
| `VNDB_MIN_SIMILARITY` | `0.35` | Minimum trigram score to accept a match |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | `5s` | How often to scan for running processes |
| `VNDB_CACHE_TTL` | `24h` | How long a `cache.csv` or `cache.db` entry is valid before re-querying VNDB |
| `STABLE_TITLE_POLLS` | `2` | Polls a title must be stable before acting |
| `CACHE_USE_DB` | `false` | **[Experimental]** Use SQLite (`cache.db`) instead of CSV (`cache.csv`) |

## Building

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Initialise submodules before building — the two header-only dependencies are not
> downloaded automatically.
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

## Dependencies

| Library | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [discord-presence](https://github.com/EclipseMenu/discord-presence) | Discord Rich Presence (modern C++ rewrite) |
| [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) | JSON parsing |
| [cpp-logger](https://github.com/jayng9663/cpp-logger) | Logging |

## Usage

> [!TIP]
> Run with `--verbose` if a title is not being detected or matched — the debug output shows
> exactly which process was found, what VNDB returned, and the similarity score.

```bash
./vn-discord-rpc            # normal
./vn-discord-rpc --verbose  # debug logging
./vn-discord-rpc --help
```

Launch a game through **Lutris** or **Steam**, and the daemon will detect it automatically. Press `Ctrl+C` to quit cleanly.
